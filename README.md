This is the Britt Cyr submission for http://engineering.footballradar.com/competitions/world-cup-2014.html

1. Create a rating for every team by running a least squares algorithm with a tweakable home field advantage

2. Establish an outcome probability for every combination of teams in the bracket based on ratings

3. Run many simulations of the tournament


To run the project:
python simulation.py
